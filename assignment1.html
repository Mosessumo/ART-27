            Subjects of study</b><br>
            
            <br>
          At the Starz University, we have a pretty open-minded research facility---as long as the subjects<br>
          fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intellihent, dedicated<br>
          researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.<br>
          Saying that, of the ideas<br>you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
          <p></p>
          
          <br>
          Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefit of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)<br>
          Measuring the effort on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatur exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C(86<sup>o</sup>F),
          <br>when the audience size exponentially increases (effort of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)
          
          <br><br>
          HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical score.<br<br>
          So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd<br>
          expect the research to take, reuired staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.<br><br>
          
         <b>Exotic dance moves</b>
         
         <br><br> 
          Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances.
          To answer your question, my favourite dances are as folloes, with definitions:
          
          <br><br>
          <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt><br>
          <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village
          would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd><br>
          <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt><br><dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice<br>

          tnhis dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling<br>
          thier bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow<br>
          students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd><br>
          <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt><br><dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English exlosers in the 1960s<br>
          believed to have discovered a new dance style characterizedby "robotic", stilted<br>
          movements, being practiced by inhabitants of northern Alaska and Canada. Laterl on <br>
          however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really<br>cold.</dd>
          
          <br>

          <br><br>Yours sincerely,
